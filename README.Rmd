This project is an exploratory walk through different prediction methods applied on a housing dataset.
The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/miami-housing-dataset

The project includes the comparison of RMSEs from different prediction techniques, namely:

- OLS
- Split-sample cross-validation
- Bootstrapping
- LOOCV
- Bagging
- Boosting
- Random Forest

The RMSE comparison gives us a basic understanding about which technique produces the best predictions.
